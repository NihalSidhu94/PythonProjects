# Python
These are the Python projects that I have been working on/completed during my internship at Birlasoft.

### A1 - "Guess a number from 1 to 100"
This assignment involved me creating a project that randomized a value from 0 - 100, and a user had infinite number of guesses to reach the correct randomized value. The project would respond to the user, depending on how many guesses it took, and the user recieves an option to play again. I had to validate if user responses were actually number values.

### A2 - "Store email addresses and phone numbers"
This assignment involved me creating a project that created a formatted printed list of an address book. The user would have an option to print the existing entries, add an entry, or exit the program. If the user wished to add an entry, this new entry would be added to the existing entries. I had to validate which option the user chose.

### A3 - "Calculate a circle's circumference and area"
This assignment involved me creating a project that would allow the user to input a radius value, and in return recieve the circle's area and circumference. Along with receiving the area and circumference, the program would output the number of circle objects that were created. I had to validate whether input was a valid number.

### A4 - "Roll the dice"
This assignment involved me creating a project where a user would play a game similar to Craps. It  would allow a user to roll two dice, and the total of the two dice result would indicate whether the user won a prize or not. The project involved me utilizing multiple objects and classes, such as a Die class and PairOfDice. I had to validate whether the user responded yes or no.

### A5 - "Create an object-oriented validation class"
This assignment involved me creating a project where a user would input an integer, double, string, and a specified string. While the user did this, my program would validate whether the response was the intended data type. If it wasn't the program would continue to ask the user to input a value till they inputted the correct data type. This focused in on validating data types, while using object oriented programming.

### Assignment 6 - "Work with customer and employee data"
This assignment involved me creating a project where a user would either input data for an employee or a customer, and the program would print out the information in a formatted form. This program validated user's response to ensure correct values were inputted, and this program inheritance, where a customer and employee class inherited the Person class.
